# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup React Project with Testing Infrastructure
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize React application using Create React App with comprehensive testing setup and CSS Modules configuration
# Details:
1. Run `npx create-react-app translation-management-ui`
2. Install additional dependencies: `npm install --save-dev @testing-library/jest-dom @testing-library/user-event`
3. Configure CSS Modules by ejecting or using CRACO
4. Set up project structure: src/components, src/services, src/utils, src/styles
5. Configure Jest with setupTests.js for React Testing Library
6. Create initial .gitignore and README.md
7. Set up ESLint and Prettier for code consistency
8. Create basic App.js structure with routing placeholder

# Test Strategy:
Verify project builds successfully with `npm start` and `npm test`. Test CSS Modules work by creating a sample component with scoped styles. Ensure all testing utilities are properly configured.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create React App Installation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Initialize new React application using Create React App and verify basic setup
### Details:
Run `npx create-react-app translation-management-ui` to create the base React application. Verify the installation by running `npm start` and ensuring the default React app loads successfully in the browser. Check that all core dependencies are properly installed and the development server starts without errors.

## 2. Install Additional Dependencies [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Install testing libraries, CSS Modules support, and other required dependencies
### Details:
Install additional dependencies using `npm install --save-dev @testing-library/jest-dom @testing-library/user-event @craco/craco` for enhanced testing capabilities. Install CSS Modules support and any other required packages for the project. Update package.json scripts to use CRACO for configuration overrides.

## 3. Configure Build Tools and CSS Modules [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Set up CRACO configuration for CSS Modules and customize build process
### Details:
Create craco.config.js to enable CSS Modules without ejecting. Configure CSS Modules to work with .module.css files. Set up any additional webpack configurations needed for the project. Test that CSS Modules are working by creating a sample component with scoped styles.

## 4. Create Project Directory Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.3
### Description: Establish organized folder structure for components, services, utilities, and styles
### Details:
Create the following directory structure: src/components for React components, src/services for API and data services, src/utils for utility functions, src/styles for global styles, src/hooks for custom hooks, and src/context for React context providers. Remove default CRA files and organize the project structure.

## 5. Configure Testing Environment [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.4
### Description: Set up Jest configuration and React Testing Library for comprehensive testing
### Details:
Configure Jest with setupTests.js file to include React Testing Library utilities. Set up custom render functions and testing utilities. Configure test coverage reporting and ensure all testing libraries are properly integrated. Create initial test files to verify the testing setup works correctly.

## 6. Setup Code Quality Tools [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.5
### Description: Configure ESLint, Prettier, and Git hooks for code consistency and quality
### Details:
Install and configure ESLint with React-specific rules and Prettier for code formatting. Set up .eslintrc.js and .prettierrc configuration files. Configure pre-commit hooks using husky to run linting and formatting checks. Create .gitignore file with appropriate exclusions for React projects.

## 7. Create Basic App Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.6
### Description: Build the main App component structure and routing foundation
### Details:
Create the main App.js component with basic structure and routing setup if needed. Implement the main layout components and establish the component hierarchy. Set up any global providers or context that will be used throughout the application. Create a basic header and main content area structure.

## 8. Scaffold Initial Components [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.7
### Description: Create placeholder components and establish component architecture patterns
### Details:
Create initial placeholder components for the main features: TranslationGrid, LocaleSelector, SearchInput, and other core components. Establish consistent component patterns and prop interfaces. Create basic CSS Module files for each component. Set up component exports and imports to ensure the application builds successfully.
