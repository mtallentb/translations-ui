import { FixedSizeList as List } from 'react-window'
```
2. Add React.memo and useMemo optimizations for expensive operations
3. Implement pagination as fallback for virtual scrolling
4. Create src/components/ErrorBoundary.js for error catching
5. Add loading states and skeleton screens
6. Implement debounced search and validation
7. Add error handling for API operations with retry logic
8. Create src/hooks/useErrorHandler.js for consistent error management
9. Implement lazy loading for locale data
10. Add performance monitoring and metrics collection
11. Optimize bundle size with code splitting

# Test Strategy:
Performance test with 1000+ translations, verify virtual scrolling works smoothly, error boundaries catch and display errors gracefully, loading states provide good UX. Test memory usage and rendering performance.
