# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Search Functionality
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add real-time search capability across translation keys, base values, and translated values
# Details:
1. Create src/components/SearchInput.js with debounced input
2. Implement search logic in src/utils/searchUtils.js:
```javascript
const filterTranslations = (translations, query, selectedLocale) => {
  return translations.filter(t => 
    t.key.toLowerCase().includes(query.toLowerCase()) ||
    t.base.toLowerCase().includes(query.toLowerCase()) ||
    (t.locales[selectedLocale] && t.locales[selectedLocale].toLowerCase().includes(query.toLowerCase()))
  )
}
```
3. Add search highlighting functionality
4. Connect search to translation store with SET_SEARCH action
5. Implement search result count display
6. Add clear search functionality
7. Optimize search performance with memoization

# Test Strategy:
Test search filters correctly across all fields, highlighting works, debouncing prevents excessive filtering, search state persists during locale changes. Performance test with large datasets.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Search Input Component [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Build the SearchInput component with proper styling and event handling
### Details:
Create src/components/SearchInput.js with input field, search icon, clear button, and proper accessibility attributes. Include CSS Modules styling for consistent appearance and responsive design.

## 2. Implement Debouncing Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Add debouncing mechanism to prevent excessive search operations
### Details:
Implement useDebounce hook or integrate debouncing directly into SearchInput component. Set appropriate delay (300-500ms) to balance responsiveness with performance.

## 3. Develop Search Algorithm [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create search utility functions for filtering translations
### Details:
Implement src/utils/searchUtils.js with filterTranslations function that searches across translation keys, base values, and locale-specific translations. Include case-insensitive matching and partial string matching.

## 4. Implement Search Result Highlighting [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.3
### Description: Add highlighting logic to emphasize search matches in results
### Details:
Create highlighting utility functions that wrap matched text in highlight spans. Implement proper escaping for HTML content and ensure highlighting works across all searchable fields.

## 5. Optimize Search Performance [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.3
### Description: Implement performance optimizations for large datasets
### Details:
Add memoization for search results, implement virtual scrolling if needed, and optimize filtering algorithms. Consider indexing strategies for improved search performance with large translation sets.

## 6. Integrate Search State Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.2, 4.3
### Description: Connect search functionality to the application state system
### Details:
Update translation store to include searchQuery state, implement search actions in reducer, and ensure search state persists during locale changes. Connect SearchInput component to global state.

## 7. Complete Search Integration and Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.4, 4.5, 4.6
### Description: Finalize search functionality integration with grid component and comprehensive testing
### Details:
Integrate search with TranslationGrid component, ensure highlighting displays correctly in grid cells, implement search result count display, and conduct thorough testing including edge cases and performance validation.
