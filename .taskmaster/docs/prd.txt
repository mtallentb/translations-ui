# Translation Management UI - Product Requirements Document

# Overview
The Translation Management UI is a React-based web application designed to streamline the management of internationalization (i18n) translations for AllianceBernstein's web applications. The system addresses the challenge of managing translation keys and values across multiple locales by providing an intuitive grid-based interface that allows content managers and developers to view, edit, create, and import translations efficiently.

The product solves the problem of scattered translation management by centralizing all translation operations in a single, user-friendly interface. It's designed for content managers, localization teams, and developers who need to maintain accurate translations across different languages while ensuring data integrity and preventing duplicate keys.

The value proposition lies in reducing translation management overhead, improving translation accuracy, and providing real-time validation to prevent common errors like duplicate keys or invalid formats.

# Core Features

## Grid-Based Translation Editor
- **What it does**: Displays translations in a searchable, sortable grid with inline editing capabilities
- **Why it's important**: Provides efficient bulk editing and overview of all translations in a familiar spreadsheet-like interface
- **How it works**: Each row represents a translation key with columns for the key name, base value, and locale-specific translations. Users can click to edit cells inline with immediate validation feedback

## Multi-Locale Support
- **What it does**: Supports predefined locale codes (en-us, zh-tw, ja-jp, ko-kr, es-es, etc.) with dynamic language selection
- **Why it's important**: Enables management of translations across multiple markets without requiring system changes for new locales
- **How it works**: Dropdown selector allows users to choose which locale they want to view/edit, with the grid updating to show relevant translation columns

## Comprehensive Search Functionality
- **What it does**: Real-time search across translation keys, base values, and translated values
- **Why it's important**: Enables quick location of specific translations in large datasets
- **How it works**: Search input filters the grid in real-time, highlighting matching text across all visible columns

## Import Functionality
- **What it does**: Allows bulk import of translations from JSON files
- **Why it's important**: Enables efficient migration of existing translations and bulk updates
- **How it works**: File upload with validation and preview before applying changes to the translation store

## Change Tracking and Save/Cancel Workflow
- **What it does**: Tracks all modifications with visual indicators and provides save/cancel options
- **Why it's important**: Prevents accidental data loss and provides clear feedback on what has been modified
- **How it works**: Modified cells are highlighted, changes are stored in memory until explicitly saved, with ability to revert individual changes or all changes

## Key Validation System
- **What it does**: Prevents duplicate keys and validates key format in real-time
- **Why it's important**: Maintains data integrity and prevents runtime errors in applications using the translations
- **How it works**: Client-side validation with immediate feedback, following recommended naming conventions while allowing flexibility

# User Experience

## User Personas
1. **Content Manager**: Non-technical user who needs to update translation content regularly
2. **Localization Specialist**: Manages translations across multiple languages and needs bulk editing capabilities
3. **Developer**: Technical user who needs to add new translation keys and maintain the translation system

## Key User Flows

### Editing Existing Translations
1. User opens the application
2. Selects target locale from dropdown
3. Uses search to find specific translations (optional)
4. Clicks on cells to edit values inline
5. Sees visual feedback for modified fields
6. Reviews changes and saves or cancels

### Creating New Translations
1. User clicks "Add New Translation" button
2. Enters new translation key with validation feedback
3. Enters base value and locale-specific translations
4. System validates for duplicate keys
5. User saves the new translation

### Importing Translations
1. User clicks "Import" button
2. Selects JSON file containing translations
3. System validates file format and checks for conflicts
4. User reviews import preview
5. Confirms import or makes adjustments
6. System applies changes with success feedback

## UI/UX Considerations
- Clean, minimalist design focusing on content editing
- Responsive grid that works on various screen sizes
- Clear visual indicators for modified, saved, and error states
- Keyboard shortcuts for common operations
- Accessible design following WCAG guidelines
- Fast, responsive interactions with optimistic updates

# Technical Architecture

## System Components
- **React Application**: Single-page application built with Create React App
- **Translation Store**: In-memory state management for translation data
- **API Layer**: Mock API interface for future backend integration
- **Validation Engine**: Client-side validation for keys and values
- **Import/Export Service**: Handles file operations and data transformation

## Data Models
```javascript
Translation = {
  key: string,           // Unique identifier
  base: string,          // Base language value
  locales: {             // Locale-specific translations
    'en-us': string,
    'zh-tw': string,
    // ... other locales
  },
  modified: boolean,     // Tracking changes
  created: timestamp,    // Audit trail
  updated: timestamp
}

AppState = {
  translations: Translation[],
  selectedLocale: string,
  searchQuery: string,
  modifiedKeys: Set<string>,
  isLoading: boolean,
  errors: object
}
```

# Risks and Mitigations

## Technical Challenges
- **Risk**: Performance degradation with large translation datasets
- **Mitigation**: Implement virtual scrolling and pagination, optimize React rendering with memoization

- **Risk**: Complex state management for tracking changes across multiple locales
- **Mitigation**: Use immutable update patterns and clear separation of concerns in state structure

## MVP Scope Management
- **Risk**: Feature creep leading to delayed delivery
- **Mitigation**: Strict adherence to MVP scope, deferring advanced features to later phases

- **Risk**: Over-engineering the validation system
- **Mitigation**: Start with basic client-side validation, expand based on real usage patterns

## Resource Constraints
- **Risk**: Testing overhead slowing development
- **Mitigation**: Focus on high-value test cases, use TDD to guide development efficiently

- **Risk**: CSS complexity affecting maintainability
- **Mitigation**: Use CSS Modules for scoped styling, establish clear naming conventions early
