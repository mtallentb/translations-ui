		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the React project initialization into setup phases: CRA installation, dependency management, configuration tasks, project structure creation, tooling setup, and initial component scaffolding",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity due to multiple configuration steps and tooling setup. Modern React projects require careful dependency management and proper tooling configuration."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Separate the state management implementation into data modeling, Context API setup, reducer implementation, action creators, utility functions, and mock data generation",
			"reasoning": "High complexity involving React Context patterns, reducer logic, and data structure design. State management is foundational and requires careful architecture."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 9,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide UI component creation into grid structure, responsive styling, locale selector implementation, accessibility features, context integration, and state management connections",
			"reasoning": "Complex due to responsive design requirements, accessibility considerations, and multi-locale support. Grid components with proper styling require significant attention to detail."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split search functionality into input component creation, debouncing implementation, search algorithm development, highlighting logic, performance optimization, and state integration",
			"reasoning": "Medium complexity with standard search patterns. Debouncing and highlighting add complexity but follow established patterns."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 9,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break inline editing into editable cell component, edit state management, input validation, keyboard handling, optimistic updates, visual feedback, and custom hook implementation",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to state management complexity, user interaction handling, and the need for smooth UX transitions between edit and display modes."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 10,
			"expansionPrompt": "Separate change tracking into modification detection, visual indicators, save/cancel UI components, bulk operations, confirmation dialogs, keyboard shortcuts, and auto-save functionality",
			"reasoning": "Very high complexity involving complex state management, user workflow design, and data persistence patterns. Critical for application usability."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide validation system into validation utility functions, real-time validation integration, error display components, validation state management, and bulk validation features",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity with standard validation patterns. Real-time validation and error handling require careful UX consideration."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 10,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break form creation into modal component, form field implementation, validation integration, submission handling, bulk creation features, accessibility, and notification system",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to form validation, modal behavior, bulk operations, and accessibility requirements. Forms require extensive user interaction handling."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 10,
			"expansionPrompt": "Separate import functionality into file upload UI, file processing service, validation logic, preview components, conflict resolution, progress indicators, and error handling",
			"reasoning": "High complexity involving file handling, data processing, validation, and complex user workflows. Import systems require robust error handling and user feedback."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 11,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide optimization into virtual scrolling implementation, React performance optimizations, error boundary setup, loading states, performance monitoring, bundle optimization, and memory management",
			"reasoning": "Very high complexity requiring advanced React patterns, performance profiling, and optimization techniques. Critical for application scalability and user experience."
